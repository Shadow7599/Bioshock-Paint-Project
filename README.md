# Bioshock-Paint-Project
My Grade 11 Computer Science Paint Project, where the theme is of the video game series Bioshock

To run the program, just open the bioshockPlasmidsAreThePaintNew.py file in the folder. You will need to have python and the pygame
module installed in order to run the project.

You may have to install the given Andes font to have the correct font in the program. To install it, just open it and click install.
